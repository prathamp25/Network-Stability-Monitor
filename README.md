# Network-Stability-Monitor
This Python script monitors network stability by periodically pinging a target host, measuring packet loss, latency, and jitter. If any metric exceeds predefined thresholds, it flags the network as unstable. The tool helps diagnose connectivity issues for troubleshooting and performance optimization.
